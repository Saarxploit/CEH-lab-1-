All about CEH reconnaissance 
# 🕵️‍♂️ CEH Lab 1 – Information Gathering

## 🎯 Objective

This lab focuses on the reconnaissance phase of ethical hacking using both passive and active OSINT tools. The goal is to gather as much useful information as possible about a target, without directly interacting with it (passive) or with minimal interaction (active).

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- Information gathering sets the foundation for successful penetration testing.
- Tools like `Shodan`, `Censys`, and `TheHarvester` can uncover misconfigurations and leaked data with no direct contact to the target.
- Wordlists created with `CeWL` help in targeted brute-force attacks.
- Tools like `Sherlock` and `PeekYou` are valuable for social engineering and profiling.
- Metadata from public files (`Metagoofil`) often reveals usernames, software versions, and internal directory structures.
